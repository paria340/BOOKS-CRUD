## About BookShelf

Here is a full-stack web application which implements React, Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB. 

This app is called bookshelf; where you can add a new book to your book collection, edit an existing one or delete a book you no longer desire to keep. 


The back-end is hosted on Heroku and the front-end on Netlify. Here is a live link to the BookShelf app if you want to try it out:
